acmxc is a script to perform calculations using Adiabatic Connection Models (ACMs) for the correlation energy. It drives electronic structure calculations from several codes and computes total energies.

acmxclib is the library used by acmxc to perform all calcualtions. This can also be used independently.

Documentation can be found in the file acmxc_manual.pdf
